# A-star

as a homework of algorithm,

target is use a* algorithm to calculate the minimum cost to n stage.

similar to multi-stage graph,

but calculate from first node to currnet node(store in d[])

then calculate the minimum cost from current node to next stage(store in h[])

then according the taget input, pick up the minimum of the specified stage.
